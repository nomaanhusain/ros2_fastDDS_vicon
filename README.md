# FastDDS with ROS 2 and Vicon Guides

This repository contains guide for using FastDDS with ROS 2 for discovery and communication. It also includes step-by-step instructions for integrating a Vicon motion-capture system with ROS 2 and for creating subjects in the Vicon Nexus application.

[FastDDS Guide](/fast-dds-guide.md): Explains how to configure ROS 2 to use FastDDS for topic discovery across multiple machines, enabling communication between distributed ROS nodes.

[ROS 2 Vicon Receiver Guide](/vicon-tracking-data-guide.md):Describes how to stream motion-capture data from the Vicon system into a ROS 2 topic, making it accessible to ROS 2 nodes (e.g., running on robots).

[Vicon Subject Creation Guide](/vicon-subject-creation.md): Provides a step-by-step guide for creating a new subject in the Vicon Nexus application.
